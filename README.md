### How fast is it?
I am getting between 20 to 37 FPS on M60 GPU. Here is a [link](https://github.com/abdullahsumbal/Installtion/blob/master/SSD_Tracker_Tests/SSD_Tracking-Report.md) to some tests I conducted. 

### What will it be able to do when it is done?
Detection, tracking and counting of people, dogs and bicycles.

### When will it be done?
End of 2018 Summer. :)

### I cant wait for the installation documentation, tell me what I need to install!
Install CUDA and CUDNN \
Install caffe using cmake,\
Install opencv3.3.1\
and run my project.\
Or shoot me a message if you very desperate :)

### How are you making all this work?
1. I am using tracking implementation from [Multitarget-tracker](https://github.com/Smorodov/Multitarget-tracker)
2. I am using [caffe](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) for running SSD detection.
3. I will be implementing my own version of counting.

### Can you provide installation and implementation documentation?
As promised, the pipeline document is out. Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pirNh674ZnlK11vpz-GIqR-w-7ng7_xvqVleqOr_CkQ/edit?usp=sharing).\
I am currently working on the testing document. Coming up soon.
