### I cant wait for the installation documentation, tell me what I need to install!
Install CUDA and CUDNN \
Install caffe using cmake,\
Install opencv3.3.1\
and run my project.\
Or shoot me a message :)

### How are you making all this work?
1. I am using tracking implementation from [Multitarget-tracker](https://github.com/Smorodov/Multitarget-tracker)
2. I am using [caffe](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) for running SSD detection.
3. I will be implementing my own version of counting.

### Can you provide installation and implementation documentation?
